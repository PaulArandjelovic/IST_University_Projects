# ASA_Projects

These two projects were part of an Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (2020) to deepen our understanding of algorithms and give us "hands-on" experience with applying certain algorithms to problems.

**NOTE -> SEE REPORTS FOR A BETTER EXPLANATION OF EACH PROJECT**

## Project_1
### Student grade predictor

The code in this project is based on the "Tarjan Algorithm" which finds SCCs in a graph. <br>
We were required to create a program where given:

- the number of students N (N > 1)
- the number of relationships between students M (M > 0)
- the grade for the first test of each student
- friendships between students

would predict the project grade that each student would receive based on their first test grade and the relationships that each student has with other students.

## Project_2
### COVID-19 flow map to allow maximum amount of people to leave their houses without getting infected

The code in this project is based on the "Edmond Karp Algorithm" which finds the maximum flow in a graph. <br>
The project in question required us to create a program, where given:

- the number of avenues and streets (M and N respectively)
- the number of shops and citizens (S and C respectively)
- the locations of every shop (S shops)
- The locations of every citizen's house (C citizen houses)

would return us the maximum amount of people allowed to leave their houses for shopping, based on their position in relation to other citizen's locations and the shop's locations.
